# ImdbClone-App

This is a simple IMDb clone project built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vanilla JavaScript. The app utilizes the OMDB API to search for movies and display information about them. Users can also mark movies as their favorites and view them later.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for movies using the OMDB API. As they type, the search results update dynamically, similar to Google's suggestions.

- **Movie Page**: Clicking on any search result opens a new page displaying more detailed information about the selected movie, including its name, photo, plot, etc.

- **Favorite Movies Page**: Users can view a list of all their favorite movies. This list is persistent, meaning it remains the same even after closing or refreshing the browser.

- **Remove from Favorites**: Each movie in the favorites list has a "üóëÔ∏è" button. Clicking on this button removes the movie from the list.
